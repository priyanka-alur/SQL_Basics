# SQL_Basics
I started learning SQL through a consistent morning study routine from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM. 
During this journey, I learned the fundamentals of SQL, including its purpose, applications, and role in business decision-making.
I gained a strong understanding of core concepts such as Data, Database, DBMS (Database Management System), and RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).
I also practiced writing SQL queries to analyze data and solve real-world business problems.
This project reflects my hands-on learning experience and continuous effort to build strong data analysis skills.
